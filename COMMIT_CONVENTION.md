# Commit Message Convention

- The commit message subject (first line) must be no longer than 80 characters.
- The subject must start with one of: `feat:`, `chore:`, or `fix:` (case sensitive).
- After the subject, leave a blank line, then write a terse description of the change as the body.
- The body should be wrapped to 100 characters per line.

## Example

```
feat: add window rules for workspace assignment

Add window rules to assign Firefox, terminal, Chrome, Slack, Cursor, and 1Password to specific
workspaces in the Hyprland configuration. This improves workflow organization and consistency.
```
